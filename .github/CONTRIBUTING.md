Thanks for your interest in the WorldWide Telescope!

All kinds of contributions, and contributors, are welcomed. The only
requirement is that contributors abide by the letter and the spirit of our
community
[code of conduct](https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/wwt-home/blob/master/conduct.md),
which essentially states that we should all treat one another with respect.

We aim to drive WWT development using standard open-development techniques
such as public issue tracking and pull requests (PRs). You should be aware,
however, that WWT development has traditionally happened in a more top-down
fashion, and the project processes are still in a state of transition. Please
bear with us as we evolve.

## Issues

Here are some generic tips for how to write a good, actionable issue report:

- Please state clearly what you expected WWT to do, and what happened instead
- Please do your best to provide a simple test case demonstrating your issue
- Please include complete and exact error messages, when appropriate

## Pull Requests

Here are some generic tips for preparing pull requests:

- Please discuss any large undertakings with the developers before spending
  much time on them. The best way to do this is to open an issue in the issue
  tracker.
- Please limit pull requests to one topic at a time. If there are multiple
  issues you'd like to fix, file a separate PR for each one.
- Please keep PRs relatively small in size, so that one person can read and
  review all of the changes in less than about an hour.
- Please break your work into small, focused Git commits whenever possible.
- Please avoid introducing unrelated changes (e.g., whitespace adjustments) in
  your PRs.
